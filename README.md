Tapmap
==========

Taprooms and brew pubs on a (http://fawcett.github.io/tapmap)[map]!

This project started out as a way to visualize the locations of the rapidly expanding number of craft beer taprooms in the Minneapolis - St. Paul area, but it is not limited to just that area.  Taprooms located anywhere in the world are welcome!

Currently, all of the establishments in the dataset sell/pour some of their own beer.  There are definitely a lot of bars and restaurants that are not associated with a local brewery, but that pour great local brews.  Maybe a second dataset should be created for that category of establishment.  

The primary motivations for this project are:
 -    Create a mobile-friendly map of local taprooms.
 -    Create and maintain a high quality PD/CC0 licensed dataset of taprooms.
 -    Provide a vehicle for new people to learn how to use Github.


 If you know of a taproom that isn't on the map, please submit a [pull request] (http://github.com/fawcett/tapmap/pulls) or file [an issue](http://github.com/fawcett/tapmap/issues)!
